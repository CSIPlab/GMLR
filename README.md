This repository provides implementation of the algorithm of the paper:
Some results:


# Requirements
1. python 2.7 (Anaconda for python 2.7: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. pytorch 0.4.1 (To install previous versions of pytorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)
3. matplotlib 2.2.3 (Installing anaconda will automatically install it.)
4. scipy 2.2.3 (Installing anaconda will automatically install it.)
